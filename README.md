## How does it work?
_This program has two functions, the first one is to encode the input file by four different compression methods and rank them based on their compression rate. And the second function is to decode a file generated by the lz77 method, which is one of the methods in the first part. You can check out documentation inside [classes.hpp](https://github.com/Chenge321/Compression-methods-summary/blob/main/classes.h) and [main.cpp](https://github.com/Chenge321/Compression-methods-summary/blob/main/main.cpp) files to help you understand how does each method work._
### Encoder:
The first function of this program is encoding the input file by four different methods:

1. Run Length Encoding (RL encoding).
   
   It is a very simple algorithm for lossless compression. It replaces repeated bytes with a simple description of the repeated character and the number of times they are repeated. Although simple and very inefficient for normal compression, it can sometimes be very useful (eg.JPEG).
2. Arithmetic Encoding
   
   It is an encoding method based on the probabilities of letter occurrences in the string. It uses those probabilities to calculate a range for every letter, then uses the range of the last letter in the string to represent the encoded string. The main idea is the same with Huffman coding, the reason I choose this method is that it has a better compression rate than Huffman coding and it uses more mathematical techniques. However, it needs much time to encode and decode for a long string.
3. LZW Encoding (Lempel-Ziv-Welch)
   
   LZW creates a dictionary (code table) to add the unknown string sequence to the dictionary. When encountering such string sequence again, LZW replaces the sequence with the dictionary index number, and the number of bytes occupied by an index number is often much smaller than the replaced string, to achieve the purpose of compression file. It has a better compression rate when deals with a highly repetitive string.

4. LZ77
   
    The main idea of LZ77 is the same as the LZW, it also uses a dictionary and symbols to represent the encoded string. The difference is lz77 uses a different method to create and construct the dictionary. LZ77 uses a forward buffer and a sliding window(represent as Tree_mark in the code). LZ77 first loads a portion of the data into a forward buffer. Once the phrase in the data passes through the forward buffer, it moves to the sliding window and becomes part of the dictionary. The main idea of the LZ77 algorithm is to constantly find the longest phrase in the forward buffer that can match the phrase in the dictionary. It has better compression rate and processing time than the basic LZW method, so it is still widely used today.

After encoding process, the program will show the following things:

1. The encode table of LZW
2. compression rate of LZW
3. result code and compression rate of Arithmetic Encoding and RL Encoding
4. compression rate of lz77
5. Rank of four methods based on the compression rate(Increasing order)

 And also, the lz77 method will create an encoded file that has a '.lz77' extension. This file can be used to decode in the second part.


### Decoder:
The second function of this program is to decode the encoded file generated by the first part of the program. The reason I choose an lz77 type file to decode is the lz77 method is the most practical and commonly used method in those four methods.

## How to use it?
Firstly, compile the main.cpp file.

1. To use the encoding function, the First argument is "E", the second argument is the name of the input text file. After running the encoding process, the program will generate an encoded file by the lz77 method. In the example, the name of this file will be test.lz77
   
   For example:
   
   ./compression E test.txt
   
   
 
 
2. To use decoding:
    The first argument is "D", the second argument is the name of the encoded file, the third argument is the name of the output file that contains the decoded result.
 
    For example:
 
    ./compression D test.lz77 decode.txt
3. The program will check the invalid input, for example:

    ./compression E test.txt test


    Please enter correct arguments.

    To encode, 1. E 2. file name

    To decode, 1. D 2. encoded file name 3. decoded file name
